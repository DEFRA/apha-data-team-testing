These tests are for the Data Teams SQL database but show a framework of how we would test our SQL querys.

The test can currently only be ran loacally using your Microsoft account. We are currently setting up a SA for automatic running.

- To run the tests locally you must first set up a venv and install the required librarys in the requirements.txt file.
- Then run the command in the env_variable.txt file.
- Finally run the tests with the command pytest -rA from the home directory.
